        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Weiyi Zhao and my English name is Wendy. I come from China. I am a second years student in college. Four years ago I came to United State and attended high school in Portland. Now I having a cat. Her name is Xuebi. She is a British shorthair and she is very cute and quiet. I enjoy every moment that I had spend with her. I live with my friends we rent a house. My roomie are so friendly, we will give each other best wish every single day. We all hope we can live longer and enjoy the wonderfully life. One of my roomie she go to work mostly every day. She is working so hard. I wish I can be like her. I like to listen music, the song ‚ÄúOld town road‚Äù had become my favorite. I really like the melody of that song.
I am a staff member in a club call Chinese Union. I know that club from my friend and he want me to get in this club so that we can work together. But he is not longer in Chinese Union anymore because he got really sick. I will go to hospital to visti him if I have time. He is a nice guy, I will miss him. Anyway, Chinese Union is a club that try to help people and having some interesting events, so that our student can have more fun in the school. Chinese Union will provide resource  for the student who need it. I think that‚Äôs a really nice thing.
About three ago, I had attended an event was called ‚ÄúIf You Are the One.‚Äù The purpose of this event is help you to find your love. This idea was came from aTV show. There will be couple girls and boys. They do not know each other at all, and this event will help them get to know each other. If they are interest with each other. They can start dating. I am a staff member so I need to help to set up the show. I put up all the charis. After that I need to check is every audience have their ticket. It‚Äôs pretty tired. However, it‚Äôs a really good show I really enjoy it.<br><br>
